# Fairdrop VPP

This repository contains all the scripts required to reproduce the experimental section in the paper "V. Addanki, L. Linguaglossa, J. Roberts and D. Rossi. Controlling software router resource sharing by fair packet dropping" presented at IFIP networking 2018. The scripts can also reproduce the experimental section in the extended journal submission of the paper in OTCS. VPP stands for "Vector Packet Processing", a novel packet processing application which is part linux foundation project FD.io. We use VPP as the software routing application in our experiments.

We propose an exact fairdropping algorithm to achieve resource fairness among flows in a software router. This repository serves as an experimental verification of the proposed algorithm. Please read the paper referenced above for more details on the algorithm and its implementation in VPP.

## Test-bed

A test-bed similar to the figure below is required to run the experiments. An exact same machine will generate plots same as shown in the paper. But, it is not necessary to have the exact same machine to verify the validity of the algorithm. Using the scripts in this repository, any machine with similar setup will be able to generate similar results (similar but not exact) as presented in the paper.
```
TGS - Traffic generator and Sink
DUT - Device Under Test

### Minimum Requirements
```
4x DPDK compatible Network interfaces (Physical or Virtual)
12x cpu cores for packet generator, Flow monitor and Packet processing application.
24 Gb Hugepage memory (This is not a strict requirement. The scripts can be modified to adjust the hugepage requirements for the applications but at a compromise for performance.
```

# Getting Started

### Get Repository
git clone https://github.com/TeamRossi/vpp_fairdrop.git

### Setup

1. Edit the file config.sh in scripts folder
  *  __EXP=/path/to/vpp_fairdrop__ *
  * Change the values of all the variables in the linecards and cpu section to match your linecards and CPU
2. `source /path/to/vpp_fairdrop/scripts/config.sh` add this line at the end of $HOME/.bashrc
3. After making the changes, source config.sh or open a new terminal
4. `cd $EXP && make setup`
5. Thats all! Ready for experiments.

### How to run experiments

Simple make commands will run all the experiments corresponding to CPU and Bandwidth Fairdrop.
```
make {clean | setup | run-cpu-experiments-otcs | run-cpu-experiments-networking | run-bandwidth-experiments-otcs | run-bandwidth-experiments-networking}
```
#### Example

`make run-cpu-experiments-networking`

This command will run cpu fairdrop experiments corresponding to ifip networking 2018 paper and generates results and plots in corresponding folders.

## Looking into the results

#### Folders:

`$EXP/results` - raw data

`$EXP/scripts` - scripts

`$EXP/plots` - plots

`dpdk-stable-17.02.1` - DPDK library v17.02.1 required for the experiments. _(autogenerated folder after setup)_

`FlowMon` - Flow Monitor (Application used to monitor flow statistics) _(autogenerated folder after setup)_

`pktgen-3.1.2` - Dpdk Pktgen (packet generator) _(autogenerated folder after setup)_

#### Plots:

suffix otcs or networking is added to file names to differentiate between the versions.

`figure4` - Fairdrop vs taildrop bandwidth plot _(autogenerated folder after experiment)_

`j_index` - Jain fairness for cpu clock cycles and packets per second throughput between two classes of flows [light/heavy] _(autogenerated folder after experiment)_ 

`sanki` - Fairdrop vs taildrop cpu experiment artwork _(autogenerated folder after experiment)_
